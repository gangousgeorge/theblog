     <p>When you're building up your e-bike and loading it with gear, you will no doubt encounter how heavy things can get. One of the largest sources of weight is your battery. These can range from 15 pounds on the smaller side and 60 pounds on the big side. Finding the right balance between battery range and battery weight is one of the most important considerations. Too large a battery and your bike weight may be so high that it becomes too difficult to peddle and puts excess strain on the motor. Too small a battery you may end up getting stuck on the road out of charge. 

      In terms of mileage, it's best to look at the overall watthours of the battery. This is found by multiplying the voltage by the capacity. For the battery above, you would multiply 72V x 50ah = 3600Wh.
