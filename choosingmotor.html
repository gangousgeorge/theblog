       <p>More or less power? More power will mean more potential for draining your battery. All you end up wanting to do is go as fast as possible, at times tempted to achieve speeds similar to cars just so you aren't getting passed consistently. Yet having a more powerful motor might actually mean being more efficient and using less power.
       If you can maintain low to medium throttle/power use, you'll end up being more efficient. A smaller motor will of course not be able to use the same amount of power but when reaching it's max power will generate excessive heat and ultimetly reduce efficiency and drain more power than if you were to use the same amount of watts running through a more powerful motor.

       Understanding your geography can help you best pick the motor power for you. If you're going to be biking up a lot of hills, you may consider a mid-drive motor which allows for better torque application in low speed scenarios. </p>
