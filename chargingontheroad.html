    <p>Once you get going you're no doubt gonna see that battery indicator go down. How and where can you plug in? One good thing to do is look at places along your route and call asking if you could charge. This could mean bringing an extension cord. Ask at gas stations, make conversation and you may just leave with a full battery.
    Another thing to consider, especially if you have a larger battery, is overnight charging. This could happen at a couple places. Camping sights offer plug ins but are often quite expensive. At the same cost you may be able to find motels to charge at, offering a bed and a place to store and charge your bike. You may encounter rogue outlets on buildings and wonder if you can use them. It's best to ask but sometimes there's nobody to ask. Have at it. Talk to people, be social. You might get somewhere to sleep and charge your bike. Also, plan along the way. You may be close or passing through somewhere where a friend of a friend lives. Plan accordingly. </p>
